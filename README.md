# Project Information

The project "formulas" was my solution for a self imposed problem,
that of creating a program that is able to solve **any propositional logic formula**,
given as a string input, and displaying solutions for various parameters such as:

- number of subformulas;
- number of distinct variables;
- number of variable appearances;
- number of logical connectors (formula order);

as well as displaying the Truth Table.

This works for **any** given formula, while respecting the order of operations, as well as parentheses order.
